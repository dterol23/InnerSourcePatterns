## Title

Enterprise level source code inventory to drive business value and catalyze InnerSource

## Patlet

Enterprises manage software, in particular source code as key company asset, with less care and rigorousness than other IT hardware inventories which diminishes the opportunities to maximize business value and control liability cost. An unambiguous, complete, inexpensive, up-to-date, actionable inventory of Enterprise's source code repositories exploits opportunities to identify and support potential valuable InnerSource assets.

## Problem

* InnerSource stakeholders do not value source code at the same level of others Enterprise assets.
* Business Units want to select the right InnerSource projects to maximize outcome.
* InnerSource Program wants to support the right projects among all the potential candidates.
* There is no good consolidation of all source code and exploit of business value is ad-hoc.

## Story (optional)

Sometimes there is a story that helps people understand the pattern better.

## Context

Where does the problem exist? What are the pre-conditions? **Unchangeable** before the solution goes into place. The content here is often tied to the applicability of the pattern for other readers: "Do I have this same particular situation?"

* You work on a complex organization under continuous change (e.g., new acquisitions, changing business priorities...)
* You cannot find all source code touched, shared and consumed within your organization.
* You do not have a clear policy on default sharing level when creating a new project (e.g., Open, Inner or Closed Source)
* You cannot scan significant parts of your organization's source code looking for duplication, similarity, code smells...
* You do not know the ratios of open source, inner source and closed source.
* You cannot measure the diversity of contributions and resulting value for a given project.
* You cannot identify and optimize tech stack diversity.
* You cannot identify technical debt and determine the priorities for retirement (e.g., dead APIs/source).

## Forces

What makes the problem difficult? What are the trade-offs? These are constraints that **can be changed** at a cost. The solution might change one or more of these forces in order to solve the problem, while also in-turn changing the context.

* Fragmentation of source code hosting systems in your organization.
* Ad-hoc source code strategies scattered across your organization.
* Continuously changing map of the relationships between: projects, repositories, products, tech stacks, domains, solutions, platforms, services, components, sub-systems, people, authors, teams, external repositories.
* Diverse of software culture of different teams across your organization (e.g., more open to collaboration, more siloed...).

## Sketch (optional)

## Solutions

Verified resolutions and possible resolutions to the problem.

## Resulting Context

What is the situation after the problem has been solved? The original context is changed indirectly by way of the solution. Often this section can include discussion of the next possible Patterns/problems introduced. This section can be short in content - the solution may not introduce new problems or change much context.

## Rationale (optional)

Explains why this is the right solution; using totally different words WHY this solution balances these forces and this context to solve this problem. Can expand on what-if's or theories.

## Known Instances (optional)

Where has this been seen before? Helps to reinforce that this is a REAL pattern and that you match the context.

May mention:

* A particular business
* Anonymized instances ex: "3 companies have proven that this is a good solution" or "A large financial services org...".

## Status (optional until merging)

General pattern status is stored in GitHub's Label tagging - see any pull request. Note that this GitHub label tagging becomes less visible once the pattern is finalized and merged, so having some information in this field is helpful.

You might store other related info here, such as review history: "Three of us reviewed this on 2/5/17 and it needs John's expertise before it can go further."

## Author(s) (optional)

Often, this is yourself; If you need to, find someone in the InnerSource Commons to be the nominal author (As Told To); Could also be no-one if you do not want to take on authorship (common with a donut looking for a solution)

## Acknowledgements (optional)

Include those who assisted in helping with this pattern - both for attribution and for possible future follow up. Though optional, most patterns should list who helped in their creation.

## Alias (optional)

If this pattern is also known under a different name than what is listed unter **Title**, please list those alternative titles here. e.g. if the pattern is named after the problem it solves, a helpful alias might be one that describes the solution that is applied.
